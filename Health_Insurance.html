    <h2>What Is Health Insurance..?</h2>

<p>Health insurance is a safety net that takes care of your financial wellbeing in case of a medical emergency. A health insurance policy covers medical expenses you might incur due to accidents, illness or injury. </p>

    <p>Technically, it is a contract between you and your health insurance company. It means the insurer will bear some or all medical expenses you incur against a certain fee (premium) you will pay.  There are generally two ways through which the insurer pays for your medical expenses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Take a cashless treatment where you don’t have to pay. The insurance company pays the hospital directly.</li>
    <li>You can pay your medical expenses first and then later ask for reimbursement from the insurance company.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Types of Health Insurance Policies Available </h3>

    <p>There are basically two types of health insurance plans you can choose from — individual plan and family floater plan. Both policies can be described in a few words: a family floater as “one plan to cover them all” and Individual cover as “different strokes for different folks”. Your choice will depend entirely on factors such as your age, your kids’ ages, medical history, and budget.</p>

      <p>It is important for you to thoroughly understand both types and make a smart decision that works best for you and your family. </p>
    <h4>1.Individual cover</h4>

    <p>An individual health insurance policy is issued in the name of a single person. This means the sum insured is dedicated to the insured in its entirety. For example, if you are the policyholder and find yourself in need of hospitalisation, the insurer will cover your expenses up to the sum insured. Any leftover amount will remain available for use during the rest of the policy period.</p>

    <h4>2.Family floater cover</h4>

    <p>This plan covers the entire family under one umbrella policy. As opposed to individual health insurance, floaters require all the insured members to share the sum insured. </p>

    <p>For example, if you purchase a plan for yourself, your spouse and child, for a sum insured sum of INR 4 lakh, all three of you will be covered by the insurer within that sum, regardless of who is hospitalised. The age of only the most senior family member is considered when the premium is calculated. If you’re a young parent with small children, this could work in your favour. You’ll be able to get cover for your loved ones for a very affordable price.</p>
