    <h2>What Is Home Insurance..?</h2>

<p>Home insurance, also known as property insurance or homeowner insurance, secures your residence content and structure against unfortunate events like theft, fire, natural calamities (storm, cyclones, etc.) or man-made activities (riots and terrorism). With the onset of the monsoon, it is advisable to buy a home insurance policy, as many regions in India are prone to floods which can lead to vulnerable damages.

Hence, it is safe to have a home insurance policy to avoid such financial losses. Also, there are constant fire incidences and occurrence of natural calamities in India, which cause irreversible damage.</p>
