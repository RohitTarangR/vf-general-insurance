<h2>Five reasons why insurance matters</h2>

<p>Why is insurance important? Let’s look at five key reasons.</p>

<h3>1.  Protection for you and your family</h3>

<p>Your family depend on your financial support to enjoy a decent standard of living, which is why insurance is especially important once you start a family. It means the people who matter most in your life may be protected from financial hardship if the unexpected happens.</p>

<h3>2.  Reduce stress during difficult times</h3>

<p>None of us know what lies around the corner. Unforeseen tragedies such as illness, injury or permanent disability, even death – can leave you and your family facing tremendous emotional stress, and even grief. With insurance in place, you or your family’s financial stress will be reduced, and you can focus on recovery and rebuilding your lives.</p>

<h3>3.  To enjoy financial security</h3>

<p>No matter what your financial position is today, an unexpected event can see it all unravel very quickly. Insurance offers a payout so that if there is an unforeseen event you and your family can hopefully continue to move forward.</p>

<h3>4.  Peace of mind</h3>

<p>No amount of money can replace your health and wellbeing – or the role you play in your family. But you can at least have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened to you, your family’s financial security is assisted by insurance.</p>

<h3>5.  A legacy to leave behind </h3>

<p>A lump sum death benefit can secure the financial future for your children and protect their  standard of living.</p>
